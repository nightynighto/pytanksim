# pytanksim
### Python package for simulating sorbent-filled hydrogen (and other fluids) storage tanks

pytanksim is a package which calculates the mass and energy balances in fluid storage tanks and simulates the dynamics during processes such as refueling, discharging, dormancy, and boil-off.

It is also equipped to fit gas adsorption data on nanoporous materials to adsorption models, which then allows the inclusion of sorbent materials in the dynamic simulation.

## Installation

If you don't have python installed on your computer, it is recommended to install python via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) for easier management of different packages. You can then install pytanksim using pip from the conda command line.

```bash
$ pip install pytanksim


```
